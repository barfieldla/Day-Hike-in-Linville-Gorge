# Day Hike in Linville Gorge
<sub> One of my personal favorite hikes in Linville Gorge. 

The hike begins at the Pine Gap, which is also the trailhead for the Linville Gorge Trail - a long, strenuous loop lasting 28.6 miles. We will follow this trail for a bit, but turn at Babel Tower Trail to see the Overlook before turning back.
